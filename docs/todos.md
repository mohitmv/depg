## TODOs

1. Add support for passing the BUILD file topmost comment via config params.

2. Add support for passing cmake topmost stuff (version and project name) via config params.

3. Respect the INCLUDE_PATHs while auto-generating BUILD files because we cannot find headers otherwise anyways.

4. Test out the content in topmost BUILD file (example `gcab.so` decl will be there)

5.
