3. Respect the INCLUDE_PATHs while auto-generating BUILD files because we cannot find headers otherwise anyways.

1. Add support for passing the BUILD file topmost comment via config params.

2. Add support for passing cmake topmost stuff (version and project name) via config params.

5. Ensure that the BUILD file content is stable. (use OrderedDict well and sort the targets and deps)

6.
